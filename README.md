**Improving Gemma 2 for a Specific Language on a Budget: Post-Training Recipe**

Additional resources for Gemma Neogenesis, a [ðŸ““ Kaggle notebook for improving Gemma 2 for a specific language on a budget](ADD_LINK).
The notebook participates to the Kaggle competition: [Google - Unlock Global Communication with Gemma](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gemma-language-tuning).

## Notebook intro
The notebook demonstrates a case study on improving Gemma 2 2B's performance in Italian through Post-Training, combining Supervised Fine Tuning and Preference Tuning. The process uses both existing datasets and synthetic data generated specifically for this competition.
While focused on Italian, the cost-effective methods demonstrated can inspire similar fine-tuning approaches for other languages.
