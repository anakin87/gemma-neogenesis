## Notebook intro
The notebook demonstrates a case study on improving Gemma 2 2B's performance in Italian through Post-Training, combining Supervised Fine Tuning and Preference Tuning. The process uses both existing datasets and synthetic data generated specifically for this competition.
While focused on Italian, the cost-effective methods demonstrated can inspire similar fine-tuning approaches for other languages.
